## 1. Project Puropose

With the realization of the main goals of the Petshare application, 
it is a mobile application designed to make life easier not only for pet owners, but also for shelter owners and pet shops. 
One of the prominent features of the application is that it provides convenience to multiple user groups regarding their pets. 
Thanks to the donation option, you can share the products you want to sell with the people in need with a message, or you can sell them to other animal lovers for a reasonable price. 
Thanks to its publication page, the animal shelter once again responded to the demands correctly, with the feature of declaring its needs to its owners.
